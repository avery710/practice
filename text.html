    Remember to check out the artists' channels and sns accounts to keep up with their activities and new releases. Also seek out their Spotify profiles, especially if there's a particular artist you liked in the video, as I usually limit myself to including 2-3 songs by an artist and there might be more of their songs that I really like but ultimately skip for the video. So yea check out their pages, go to their channels, comment on their videos, all that good stuff. Links below.
